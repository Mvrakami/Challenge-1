## Overview
This first challenge was made to develop my intial skills by developing projects in CSS and HTML.
I had to create a webpage that shows a QRcode. I tryed to apply media queries and make it responsive to be consumed in other devices.

## My process

1. study the project and its gudelines.
2. add settings in the HTML's <head> (stylesheet and font links).
3. define divs used in the project:
    <main>
      <article>
        <div>
            <h1>    </h1>
            <p>    </p>
        </div>
      </article>
    </main>
4. fill tags with content (texts and image).
5. define ID and CLASSES for each section.
6. in the CSS: define :root with color and fonts.
7. work on each tag and manipulate it with padding, margin, display.
8. apply media queries for different devices.
 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

1. How to "make" a container a full page using VIEW HEIGHT (height: 98vh;).
2. The relationshp between display: RELATIVE and ABSOLUTE and father and child tags.
3. Container (father) is aways Position: Relativeas a native setting. However, it can be changed. 
4. Content (child) is Position: Absolute. In this way, we can change the viewheight, but the element will stay at the same point.
5. To keep the element in the center of the page, we use these mentioned concepts (father as Position: Relative and child as Position: Absolute) + LEFT and TOP in percent %. 
6. In addition, TRANSFORM: TRANSLATION (2 values in pixels, + ou -) to put it in a specific spot.
7. Media queries are hard. I know that we have to adapt sizes considering 3 different cathegories of devices.

### Continued development

I will make efforts to understand and make projects even more responsives.
